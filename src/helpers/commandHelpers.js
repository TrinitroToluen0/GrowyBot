## :question: How it works?
Every day at 9:00 P.M UTC, all members of your guild with the Discord-created Booster role will receive a specified amount of money. This amount is determined by you in the configuration. Additionally, these rewarded users will be publicly thanked in a designated channel within your guild, which you also need to set up.

- </boostrewarder-setreward:1201445092129517610> Set the amount of money that your server boosters will get for boosting your server.

## ü§î To consider
- Your server must have an official booster role created by Discord for this module to properly work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Actual configuration
- Enabled ‚ûû \`${guildConfig.boostRewarderEnabled}\`
- Channel ‚ûû ${guildConfig.boostRewarderChannel ? `<#${guildConfig.boostRewarderChannel}>` : "None"}

## :question: How it works?
When users bump your server executing the comand </bump:947088344167366698>, a timer will be set and 2 hours later, I will remember your users that it's time to bump again. 
Also, you can specify how much money your users can win for bumping your server.

## :question: What is a "bump"? What is Disboard?
Disboard is a website to grow your Discord server, there you can submit your server and invite the Disboard bot.  When a user "bumps" your server, 
it means that they executed the command  </bump:947088344167366698>, which will bump your server to the top of the Disboard website, and therefore, you will gain new 
members, a bump can be done every 2 hours.

## ${commands} Available commands

- </bumpreminder-setrole:1202771703688863834> Sets a role to mention when reminding your users to bump your server.

## ü§î To consider
- This module requires you to have your server submitted and approved on the [Disboard website](https://disboard.org/).
- This module requires you to have the Disboard bot setup in your server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Actual configuration

    return `# üè¶ Economy category

## :question: How it works?
This is a currency system that allows users to buy items on your guild shop configured by you.

## :question: How can my users earn money?

With the boost rewarder module, users can earn money bumping the server, with the boost rewarder module, users can earn money daily by boosting the server. With the invites module, users can earn money inviting othe users to your server. There is also a few commands to give money to your users manually.

## :question: How can my users spend money?
You can set a shop and add items to it with the command </shop-add:1213246942776262686>, you can set a price and users can pay for it.

## ${commands} Available commands

## ü§î To consider
- The shop does not have an implemented inventory system and therefore is not automatic. You need to set a channel / webhook to know if a user bought an item.
- The webhook is for developers, is not a discord webhook, it is an URL where i will send a POST request to, containing the data of the buyer and the item bought.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Actual configuration
- Channel ‚ûû ${guildConfig.shopChannel ? `<#${guildConfig.shopChannel}>` : "None"}
- Webhook ‚ûû ${guildConfig.shopWebhook ? `${guildConfig.shopWebhook}` : "None"}
